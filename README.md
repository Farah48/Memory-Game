## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

Answer:I used www.w3schools.com to pick colors.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

Answer: There were few times when my program did not behave in the expected way. It was mostly because of either spelling error or not changing the buttons’
name after copying and pasting the first line of html code for button. For instance, I had three HTML buttons as button 1. However, on CSS I named them correctly.
So, after implementing CSS code only one button changed its color and other buttons were just same as they were before I wrote CSS code. It was not very tricky to
guess what caused this issue. Sooner, I realized perhaps I didn’t change their names. Then, I checked the CSS file and fixed the issue. On this project this error
was a reoccurring issue. Similar problem occurred again while I was adding two additional buttons. I did not change the onclick attribute’s value after coping them
from previous line of code which was for button 4.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   To complete this submisssion

Answer: To complete this submission I was required to use JavaScript along with HTML and CSS. I am wondering is there any other object oriented language that we
use in web development.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc).
   Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

Answer:I would implement all the optional features if I had few more hours to work on this project. I would also create an animated character that would react every time
the player wins or loses the game. For example, every time the player wins the character will show a speech bubble to congratulate the player. It will also the celebrate
player’s win by jumping and laughing. On the contrary, it makes a sad face and shows a speech bubble with condolence for every time the player loses the game.
